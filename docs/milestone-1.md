###### ImMemorable
##### Team Overview: 
###### Evely R. Cruz
##### Application Idea: 
###### Given all the shootings, suicide rates, and depression rates I thought that a beneficial website would be one that provided people with resources. It could be hotlines, links to support groups, positive quotes. 
###### I have close friends of different backgrounds and lifestyles who have and/or continue to suffer from depression, have attempted suicide, and others who have even "succeeded". My sister is a mental health counselor at a well known hospital in Boston and one of the projects that she did was posting positive quotes around her unit (psych ward). She mentioned how one of her patients approached her and thanked her for having done that. This patient even asked her to put a quote that said "love yourself". This patient mentioned that growing up no one taught her how to and that was one of the things that she struggled with the most.
###### I think a website like this could be beneficial to anyone not just a specific group of people. The name of the website is ImMemorable. This comes from I'm Memorable since most of the people that I know that struggle with depression struggle with their self worth. The name could also be read as Immemorable to refer to any events or feelings that may have influenced them negatively, as a sense that those events must be forgotten (and healed).
